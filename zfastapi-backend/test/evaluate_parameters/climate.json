    "problem_statement": "Climate change has become one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation are significantly impacting ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide. One of the major contributors to climate change is carbon emissions from industrial activities, transportation, and deforestation. Despite international efforts, reducing carbon footprints remains a challenge due to a lack of sustainable alternatives, economic constraints, and limited public awareness. To address this, governments, organizations, and researchers are actively seeking innovative solutions that promote renewable energy adoption, sustainable urban planning, and green technologies. The goal is to transition towards a low-carbon economy while maintaining economic growth and social well-being.",

    "student_submission": "PROPOSAL: Leveraging AI and IoT for Smart Carbon Footprint Monitoring and Reduction. Climate change is exacerbated by excessive carbon emissions from industries, transportation, and households. Our solution introduces an AI-powered carbon footprint monitoring system that utilizes IoT sensors to track real-time emissions data from factories, vehicles, and homes. The system processes this data using machine learning to provide actionable insights on reducing emissions. It suggests optimized energy consumption strategies, alternative fuel sources, and incentives for adopting green technologies. Additionally, a mobile application will engage individuals by offering personalized carbon footprint tracking and gamified challenges to encourage sustainable behavior. Our approach combines AI, IoT, and behavioral science to drive impactful and scalable environmental change.",
